# Book Description

We are in such an era where cyber security plays an important part. With systems getting smarter, we are seeing machine learning interrupting computer security. With the adoption of machine learning in upcoming security products, it is important for pentesters and security researchers to understand the working of these systems and breach them.

This book will begin with some basics about Machine learning and the algorithms used to build robust systems. Once you have gained a fair understanding about how security products are leveraging machine learning this book will dive in to the core concepts of breaching such systems. With the help of practical usecases this book will teach you how to find loop holes and surpass a self-learning security system. This book will focus on topics like Network intrusion detection, Spam detection, Security log analysis, Attacker Identification, Anomaly based detection, MAC address Spoofing detection over WiFi, Confusing Anomaly Detectors, Rogue Wi-Fi network detection, AV and IDS Evasion, Time Series based Data Analysis, Subverting Learning Systems and so on. Lastly, this book will also cover best practices on identifying ambiguities and extensive techniques on breaching an intelligent system.

By the end of this book, you will be well-versed with identifying loop holes in a self-learning security system and will be able to efficiently breach a machine learning system.
